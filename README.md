## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects:

### 1. [Stock Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/Kaua-vas/Portfolio/tree/main/Inventory%20Demand%20Forecast)
A Machine Learning model to forecast stock demand based on historical data. Utilizes **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow** to build a predictive model, with key features including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Key Features:
- Predicts stock demand based on historical sales, promotions, and seasonality.
- Includes visualizations for sales predictions vs. historical sales.
- Leverages a neural network model built with **TensorFlow** and optimized with **Adam**.

### 2. [Sentiment Classification in Comments](#) (ongoing)
An NLP project to classify sentiment in comments using **Hugging Face Transformers** and **Scikit-learn**.

### 3. [Image Recognition (Computer Vision)](#) (ongoing)
Uses **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow** for object classification and recognition in images, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### 4. [Fraud Detection in Transactions](#) (ongoing)
A classification model to identify fraudulent transactions using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**.

### 5. [BI Report Automation](#) (ongoing)
Automated pipeline for generating Business Intelligence reports using **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**.
