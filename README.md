## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects:

1. [Stock Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/Kaua-vas/Portfolio/tree/main/Inventory%20Demand%20Forecast)
A Machine Learning project focused on forecasting stock demand using historical sales data from the **Rossmann Store Sales dataset**. The goal is to predict future sales considering various factors such as promotions, store type, and holidays. The model was built using **Pandas** for data processing, **Scikit-learn** for initial model exploration, and **TensorFlow** for implementing a neural network.

Key Features:
- Predicts stock demand based on historical sales data, including promotions, store types, and seasonality.
- Uses **TensorFlow** to implement a neural network model, optimized with the **Adam** optimizer.
- Includes detailed **data preprocessing** steps, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- Visualizations comparing **predicted sales vs. actual sales** to assess model performance and improvements.

### 2. [Sentiment Classification in Comments](https://github.com/Kaua-vas/Portfolio/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Sentiments%20in%20Comments)  
An NLP project to classify sentiment in IMDb reviews of *The Acolyte* episodes using **Hugging Face Transformers**. This project involves web scraping, text preprocessing, and sentiment analysis, and includes visualizations to explore sentiment trends across different episodes.

Key Features:
- Scrapes IMDb reviews for each episode of *The Acolyte* using **BeautifulSoup**.
- Preprocesses text using **SpaCy** for tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Classifies reviews as positive or negative using **Hugging Faceâ€™s DistilBERT** model.
- Generates visualizations of sentiment trends and confidence levels per episode using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Organizes and processes data using **Pandas**.

### 3. [Image Recognition (Computer Vision)](#) (ongoing)
Uses **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow** for object classification and recognition in images, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### 4. [Fraud Detection in Transactions](#) (ongoing)
A classification model to identify fraudulent transactions using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**.

### 5. [BI Report Automation](#) (ongoing)
Automated pipeline for generating Business Intelligence reports using **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**.
